# SlapsOnlineDemo
SlapsOnlineDemo Unreal Engine 4.27 Demo reel for job postulation.

Entire project made in Unreal Engine 4.27.2

Instructions provided:

* That it consists of 2 characters with overlapping type collisions, that can hit each other, with animations that denote when you hit and when the other character receives damage (they can be placeholder animations).
* The following is optional: Each character has to be controlled by a different computer (ie, online). The infrastructure has to be such that a client acts as a server (normally it is the default in the editor), not as a dedicated server. That is, one of the players is both a server and the others act as a client.
Every asset used not provided by Unreal was use just for demonstration purposes, and in no way shape or form any compensation will come out from this project.
